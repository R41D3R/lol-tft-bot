# Enviroment
- [ ] Reroll Probabilities (Max Champs in Pool vs Enemies + Level) -> Do perfect Probs. but Agent uses only Approximations
- [ ] *Karusel Probabilities*
- [ ] Drops (Items, Gold, Champs)
- [ ] *Which Players get matched?*
- [ ] How much dmg does the winner on the opponent? [Link](https://lolchess.gg/guide/damage)
> same from in game actions
- [ ] Reroll
- [ ] Level Up
- [ ] Buy Champ
- [ ] Sell Champ
- [ ] *Select best Champ from Karussell (with Item)*
- [ ] Place Champs (Bank and Board)
- [ ] Ready for Fight
> same from game info
- [ ] Champs to buy
- [ ] Champs on Board + Champs in Bank => All Champs *(include Items, Rank,)*
- [ ] Karusel Champs with Items
- [ ] Items in Bank
- [ ] *Random View on enemies (Champs) each Round + Gold Pots, Level*
- [ ] Gold
- [ ] EXP
- [ ] Level (Max Champs)
- [ ] Health Bars from all Players
- [ ] Round counter
- [ ] Win Loose (from Health Bars or is there a option to get status with survived Champs)
- [ ] Win/ Loose Streak Counter
Do I need to include Champ Stats, Synergies ... ?
